### To Do Fancy API

Create a To Do application API. Ensure that features such as CRUD, Auth and JWT(jsonwebtoken) and facebook sign-in is implemented.

A validation should take place, ensuring only authenticated users can create new items/to-do-list in your To Do application, and each user can only see, edit and delete their own to-do lists.

Add at least one feature that makes your application unique and stand out from the rest.

The <em>To Do Fancy API</em> will be used for the 2nd Week Portofolio, where you will be assigned to create a front-end of this <em>To Do Fancy</em> application.
